# Rules for working with AshOban

## Understanding AshOban

AshOban is a package that integrates the Ash Framework with Oban, a robust job processing system for Elixir. It enables you to define triggers that can execute background jobs based on specific conditions in your Ash resources, as well as schedule periodic actions. AshOban is particularly useful for handling asynchronous tasks, background processing, and scheduled operations in your Ash application.
